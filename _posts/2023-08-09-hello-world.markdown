I thought I'd give this blogging thing a go as a way of keeping track of all my various projects throughout my life as I always feel like I'm juggling several things and this will hopefully keep me accountable for making progress with them all.

Today's fun project has been setting up this website, which still needs tweaking, but for now this will do. Now to figure out where I'm at with everything else.

### Coding
#### Puppy Tracker
An idea I've had for an app to track the weight of newborn puppies so their owners can make sure they're increasing in weight. It was inspired by my mother-in-law's dog, who had a litter of puppies on Christmas Eve and their weights were all being recorded on paper.

I'm currently learning Flutter so my plan is to write the app using that, and have it interface with a Rails API backend, since that's my primary framework, though I usually make full-stack apps with it, so this will be a change of pace.

I've got the basics written down somewhere so I'll probably write that up at some point so that it's somewhere I can easily find again.

### Cross Stitch
#### Dinosaur upon Dinosaur

I've got all the supplies for this lovely pattern, and I'm waiting on some floss drops to deal with the large amount of colours involved.

### Crochet
#### Woodland Blanket

Nearly halfway through this one. A nice, simple repeat using only single and double crochets.

#### Harvest Moon Pocket Shawl
I fancied a pocket shawl - nothing like jumping on the bandwagon just as it's already left - and liked the look of this one. Currently struggling through the first 193 rows of ribbing (though I'll likely make it longer).

### Quilting
#### Northern Stars
This should have been finished a year ago for my sister's wedding, but life kind of got in the way. Just got the last block on this to make (a reindeer!) and then I'll be joining them all together and sending it off to a longarm quilter for the quilting.

#### All The Good
I've lost steam on this one. I don't know why I thought it would be a good idea given how many half square triangles there are to make, and my general hating of all the trimming involved in the process. Maybe I'll get back to it once the other quilt's out of the way, especially since I cut into my good fabric for it...
